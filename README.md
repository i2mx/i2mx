Solve problems and makes tool, that's pretty much all I do. I try to make some interesting stuff, but I really lack motivation and so don't expect too much. My web tech stack consists of solidjs, typescript, astro, tailwind, swup. For backend i'll probably use deno deploy from now on or supabase or planetscale, idk man i'm figuring it out
